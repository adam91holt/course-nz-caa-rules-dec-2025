        {

          "id": "b",
          "text": "To establish a streamlined regulatory pathway for research and development of emerging aviation technologies",
          "correct": true
        },
        {
          "id": "c",
          "text": "To replace Parts 101 and 102 with a single unified rule",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Part 107 was specifically introduced to enable rapid development and testing of emerging aviation technologies through a streamlined regulatory framework. It does not replace Parts 101 and 102, nor does it specifically regulate commercial services or prohibit testing. Instead, it creates an organization-level approval process for approved research entities."

      "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of Part 107's streamlined approach?",
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "a",
          "text": "Organizations can operate without any safety oversight or regulations",

          "text": "Approved organizations receive a single authorization covering multiple R&D activities and iterations",

          "text": "Part 107 applies only to unmanned aircraft systems and excludes other aviation technologies",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "The streamlined approach of Part 107 moves away from per-activity approvals to organization-level authorization. This allows approved research organizations to conduct multiple tests and iterations under a single authorization, significantly reducing development timelines. Safety oversight still applies, and the framework is technology-agnostic, applying to all aviation systems."

          "text": "The framework requires separate approval for each different technology type being tested",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Being technology-agnostic means Part 107 isn't limited to specific technologies. It applies equally to unmanned aircraft, advanced air mobility, electric propulsion, autonomous systems, and future innovations not yet imagined. This ensures the rule remains relevant as technology evolves without needing constant regulatory updates."

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Part 107 is complementary to Parts 101 and 102, not a replacement. Part 101 continues to govern general drone operations, Part 102 covers non-research UAS operations, and Part 107 creates a dedicated pathway for R&D activities. Organizations may operate under multiple parts depending on their various activities."
