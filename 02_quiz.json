        {
          "id": "a",
          "text": "Part 101 - this is a non-commercial recreational operation",

        },

          "id": "b",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Part 101 governs non-commercial recreational and educational drone operations. Since the hobbyist is flying for personal enjoyment without any commercial benefit, Part 101 applies. The aircraft must still meet Part 101 specifications (typically under 25kg) and the operation must comply with airspace and safety requirements, but formal certification is not required."

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the new Transport Instrument framework introduced in the December 2025 Part 101 updates?",
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "a",

          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "The new Transport Instrument framework allows the CAA to issue targeted guidance and modify operational parameters more quickly than formal regulatory amendments. This enables faster adaptation to emerging technologies, sector developments, and new operational concepts like drone racing or specialized educational programs without requiring full rule changes."

      "question": "A commercial drone operator currently has a Part 102 certificate and flies drones for aerial photography. Which statement best reflects the reduced regulatory burden under the updated December 2025 rules?",
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "a",
          "text": "They no longer need any certification and can operate without restrictions",

          "id": "d",
          "text": "They must now recertify every month instead of annually",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "The updated Part 102 reduces regulatory burden for approved operators through: streamlined approval processes (4 weeks for standard operations), performance-based standards allowing flexible compliance, simplified documentation requirements, and periodic review model with automatic renewal for operators with good compliance history. Approved operators gain annual review instead of flight-by-flight approval."

          "text": "Part 107 - agricultural monitoring always requires research authorization",
          "correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Part 102 is triggered by commercial benefit, not just direct revenue to the operator. In this case, the farmer gains commercial benefit through improved crop health monitoring and reduced insurance risk, even though the payment comes indirectly. The December 2025 updates clearly distinguish that any commercial benefit—direct or indirect—requires Part 102 certification, separating it distinctly from Part 101 recreational operations."
