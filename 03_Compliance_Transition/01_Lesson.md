## What is Advisory Circular AC101-1?

Advisory Circular AC101-1 is a comprehensive guidance document issued by the Civil Aviation Authority to support operators transitioning to the December 2025 regulatory framework.

**Purpose**: AC101-1 provides practical guidance specifically for RPAS operators under 25kg, bridging the gap between regulatory requirements and operational reality.

**Key Focus Areas**:
- How to interpret and apply the new Part 101 requirements
- Risk mitigation strategies for compliant operations
- Best practice recommendations
- Transition pathways for operators moving between categories

The circular is **not mandatory**, but it represents the CAA's official guidance on how to meet regulatory requirements in a practical, sustainable way.

## Understanding the Transition Timeline

The December 2025 update uses a phased approach to allow operators adequate time to adapt.

### Phase 1: Foundation (December 2025 - February 2026)

This is the knowledge and preparation phase.

**What happens**:
- Regulatory changes take effect
- CAA focuses on education and stakeholder support
- Operators begin implementing systems changes
- No enforcement action for good-faith compliance efforts

**What operators do**:
- Review AC101-1 and applicable regulations
- Assess current operations against new requirements
- Identify any gaps in compliance
- Begin updating procedures and documentation

### Phase 2: Transition (March 2026 - June 2026)

This is the active transition phase where operators implement changes.

**Key deadlines**:
- **30 April 2026**: Commercial operators must submit updated Part 102 certification applications
- **Various dates**: Operators complete training, certification renewals, and documentation updates
- Enhanced compliance support from CAA

**What operators do**:
- Complete required training and certifications
- Implement operational procedure changes
- Submit applications or registrations as required
- Conduct full compliance reviews

### Phase 3: Full Compliance (July 2026 onward)

This marks the end of transition provisions and full enforcement begins.

**What changes**:
- All transition allowances expire
- Full enforcement of new regulations
- No exceptions for incomplete compliance
- Standard penalty provisions apply for violations

## Early 2026 Feedback Opportunities

The CAA has scheduled several opportunities for stakeholders to provide feedback on the new framework and implementation experience.

### Scheduled Consultation Events

**Formal Feedback Period**: February 2026 (dates to be confirmed)

The CAA will accept structured feedback on:
- Implementation challenges operators are experiencing
- Areas where AC101-1 guidance could be clarified
- Operational barriers or unforeseen compliance issues
- Data on transition costs and practical impacts

### How to Participate

Feedback opportunities will be announced through:
1. **CAA Website**: Official notices and submission portals
2. **Industry Forums**: Organized feedback sessions by region
3. **Direct Submission**: Written feedback to CAA at designated addresses
4. **Stakeholder Organizations**: Industry associations will facilitate input

**Who should participate**:
- Operators experiencing implementation challenges
- Businesses with suggestions for process improvements
- Industry experts identifying regulatory gaps
- Any stakeholder with relevant transition experience

### Why Early 2026 Matters

Feedback collected during this period could lead to:
- Clarifications or amendments to AC101-1
- Adjustments to transition timelines if justified
- Additional guidance materials
- Process improvements before full enforcement

This feedback loop demonstrates the CAA's commitment to a fair, workable transition rather than rigid implementation.

## Navigating AC101-1

### Document Structure

AC101-1 is organized by operational context:

1. **Recreational Operations**: Part 101 rules for hobbies and educational use
2. **Light Commercial Operations**: Activities with limited commercial characteristics
3. **Operational Safety**: Risk assessment, mitigation strategies, best practices
4. **Compliance Demonstrations**: How to evidence compliance with requirements
5. **Transition Pathways**: Moving between operational categories

### Finding What You Need

AC101-1 uses a question-based approach to help operators:
- Identify which section applies to their operations
- Understand specific requirements in their context
- Find practical examples and case studies
- Access additional reference materials

**Access**: Available on the CAA website (www.caa.govt.nz) in multiple formats:
- Searchable PDF
- HTML version with navigation tools
- Quick reference guides by operator category

### Using AC101-1 Effectively

**Best practice approach**:
1. Identify your operational category (recreational, light commercial, etc.)
2. Read the overview section for your category
3. Review applicable risk mitigation strategies
4. Check relevant case studies or examples
5. Cross-reference with official regulatory text as needed
6. Document how your operations align with guidance

## Impact on Drone Operations

### The Benefit: Reduced Regulatory Burden

The December 2025 update, guided by AC101-1, significantly reduces unnecessary regulatory overhead:

**For recreational operators**:
- Simple, clear rules instead of ambiguous Part 101/102 boundaries
- No certification requirements for standard hobbyist activities
- Safe operational envelope clearly defined
- Simplified compliance demonstrations

**For commercial operators**:
- Clear pathways to authorization based on operation type
- Performance-based standards allowing operational flexibility
- Faster approval processes for compliant operations
- Less paperwork for straightforward applications

### Clearer Operational Expectations

AC101-1 makes expectations explicit rather than assumed:

**You now know**:
- Exactly where recreational and commercial boundaries lie
- What constitutes compliant operation in your category
- How the CAA will assess your compliance
- What documentation you need to maintain
- When you need external approvals versus when self-authorization applies

This clarity enables confident, compliant operations without second-guessing regulatory intent.

## What Operators Need to Do Now

### Immediate Actions (By End of January 2026)

1. **Read AC101-1**: At minimum, review sections relevant to your operations
2. **Assess Compliance**: Compare current operations to new requirements
3. **Identify Gaps**: Document any non-compliant practices or needed changes
4. **Plan Changes**: Develop timeline for implementing necessary adjustments

### Before Phase 2 Begins (By End of February 2026)

1. **Complete Training**: If required for your operational category
2. **Update Procedures**: Revise operations manuals and checklists
3. **Obtain Certifications**: Renew or obtain any required credentials
4. **Prepare Applications**: If transitioning categories, begin application preparation

### During Phase 2 (March - June 2026)
