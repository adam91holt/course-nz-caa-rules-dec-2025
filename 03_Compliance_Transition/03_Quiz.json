        {
          "id": "a",
          "text": "To establish mandatory regulations that operators must follow",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "AC101-1 is not mandatory. It is guidance document that represents the CAA's official recommendations for compliant operations, not binding regulations."
        },
        {
          "id": "b",
          "text": "To provide practical guidance for RPAS operators under 25kg during the regulatory transition",
          "correct": true,
          "feedback": "Correct! AC101-1 is specifically designed to provide practical, CAA-endorsed guidance for operators transitioning to the December 2025 framework, focusing on compliance pathways and best practices."

          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "AC101-1 does not replace regulatory requirements. It provides guidance on how to interpret and apply existing regulatory requirements in practical operational contexts."

          "id": "d",
          "text": "To outline penalties for operators who do not comply with new rules",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "AC101-1 is a guidance document focused on helping operators comply. Enforcement penalties are covered in the Civil Aviation Rules themselves, not in advisory circulars."

          "text": "31 December 2025",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "31 December 2025 marks the end of Phase 1 (Foundation), not the application deadline. Commercial operators have longer to prepare their applications."

          "text": "30 June 2026",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "While 30 June 2026 is near the end of Phase 2, the actual application deadline is 30 April 2026, providing time for CAA processing before Phase 3 full compliance begins."

          "text": "Education and support, with no enforcement action for good-faith compliance efforts",
          "correct": true,
          "feedback": "Correct! During Phase 1, the CAA prioritizes education and stakeholder support. Operators making good-faith efforts to understand and implement changes are not subject to enforcement action."

          "text": "Selective enforcement only against large commercial operators",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "Enforcement approach during Phase 1 applies across all operator categories. Phase 1 is fundamentally different—it's the education phase, not an enforcement phase for any category."
        },
        {
          "id": "d",
          "text": "No oversight at all—operators can do whatever they want during Phase 1",
          "correct": false,
          "feedback": "While Phase 1 is educational rather than enforcement-focused, compliance expectations still apply. The difference is the CAA's approach emphasizes support and understanding."
