# Understanding Part 107: Research & Development Framework

## What is Part 107?

Part 107 is a new Civil Aviation Rule that establishes a dedicated regulatory pathway for research and development (R&D) activities in aviation. It creates a framework that allows approved organizations to rapidly develop, test, and validate emerging aviation technologies.

## The Core Purpose

**Part 107 enables rapid development and testing of emerging aviation technologies through a streamlined, organization-level approval process.**

Instead of seeking approval for each individual test, iteration, or experimental flight, approved research organizations operate under a single regulatory authorization that covers their R&D activities.

## Who Benefits from Part 107?

Part 107 is designed for:

- **Research Institutions**: Universities and research centers developing new aviation concepts
- **Technology Companies**: Organizations innovating in aerospace and aviation systems
- **Equipment Manufacturers**: Companies testing new aircraft systems and components
- **Approved Operators**: Established organizations with safety track records and proper infrastructure
- **Emerging Technology Developers**: Groups exploring novel applications in aviation

## How Part 107 Works

### The Streamlined Approach

Traditional regulatory model:
1. Develop an idea
2. Apply for approval
3. Get approved for that specific test
4. Want to iterate? Apply again
5. Each iteration requires separate approval

Part 107 model:
1. Organization meets Part 107 standards
2. Receive single R&D authorization
3. Conduct multiple tests and iterations under that authorization
4. Rapid development cycle without repeated approvals

### Operational Freedom

Once approved under Part 107, organizations gain:

- **Flexibility to iterate**: Test multiple design variations and approaches
- **Faster development cycles**: Reduce time between concept and implementation
- **Reduced administrative burden**: Less time on approvals, more time on development
- **Innovation encouragement**: Framework supports experimentation and learning

## Technology-Agnostic Framework

A critical feature of Part 107 is that it's **technology-agnostic**. The rule doesn't specify which aviation systems are allowed—it applies to all aviation technology types:

- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (drones)
- Advanced Air Mobility (urban air mobility, flying taxis)
- Alternative propulsion systems (electric, hydrogen, hybrid)
- Autonomous flight systems
- Traditional aircraft modifications and innovations
- Emerging concepts not yet categorized

This approach ensures Part 107 remains relevant as technology evolves, without requiring regulatory updates to accommodate each new innovation.

## Key Advantages Over Previous Framework

| Aspect | Before Part 107 | Part 107 |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Approval Process** | Per-activity approvals | Organization-level authorization |
| **Development Speed** | Slow (each iteration needs approval) | Fast (multiple iterations under one approval) |
| **Technology Scope** | Prescriptive (specific technologies listed) | Technology-agnostic (applies to all aviation systems) |
| **Regulatory Certainty** | Limited to approved activities | Broader R&D scope for approved organizations |

## Safety and Oversight

Part 107 doesn't mean unregulated experimentation. The framework includes:

- **Approval Criteria**: Organizations must meet safety and operational standards
- **Ongoing Oversight**: Regulatory monitoring of R&D activities
- **Clear Boundaries**: R&D activities are distinct from commercial operations
- **Safety Requirements**: Organizations must demonstrate competence and safety management

## Entry Requirements

To operate under Part 107, organizations typically must:

1. Demonstrate competence in R&D operations
2. Have appropriate facilities and infrastructure
3. Implement safety management systems
4. Provide transparency in testing and data collection
5. Meet insurance and liability requirements
6. Show financial and organizational stability

## Part 107 in Context

Part 107 is not a replacement for Parts 101 or 102. Instead:

- **Part 101** continues to govern general drone operations
- **Part 102** covers unmanned aircraft operations for non-research purposes
- **Part 107** creates a special pathway for R&D and emerging technology development

Organizations may operate under multiple parts depending on their activities.

## The Bigger Picture

Part 107 represents New Zealand's commitment to:

- Being a global hub for aviation innovation
- Supporting technological advancement without compromising safety
- Creating regulatory certainty for researchers and innovators
- Maintaining a flexible framework that can accommodate future technologies

## Key Takeaways

- Part 107 is a dedicated R&D regulatory framework—not a general operating rule
- It enables organization-level approval rather than activity-by-activity approval
- The framework is technology-agnostic, supporting all aviation system types
- Approved organizations can conduct rapid iterations and testing
- Safety standards are maintained through organizational oversight, not per-activity approvals
- Part 107 complements, not replaces, Parts 101 and 102
