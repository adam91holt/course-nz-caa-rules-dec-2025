# Part 101: Unmanned Aircraft Operating Rules Updates

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand what Part 101 covers and its scope
- Identify the key updates made to Part 101 in December 2025
- Explain the new Transport Instrument and its purpose
- Recognize how the updates improve operational clarity for standard drone users

## What is Part 101?

Part 101 governs the operation of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in New Zealand. It applies to recreational and educational drone operations conducted in a safe, responsible manner without commercial revenue generation.

### Key Characteristics of Part 101 Operations

- **Non-commercial focus**: Operations must not generate revenue or provide commercial benefit
- **Size limitations**: Generally applies to aircraft under specific weight thresholds
- **Line of sight requirement**: Visual contact with the aircraft during flight
- **Airspace restrictions**: Operation in controlled airspace requires specific approval
- **Operational simplicity**: Designed for hobbyists, enthusiasts, and educational users

## What Changed in December 2025?

### 1. Enhanced Distinction from Part 102

The updated Part 101 now provides **clearer separation** between recreational and commercial operations.

**Before December 2025**:
- Part 101 included some quasi-commercial activities that created confusion
- Boundary between Part 101 and Part 102 was unclear in certain scenarios

**After December 2025**:
- Part 101 is exclusively for non-commercial operations
- Commercial operations—even small ones—now fall under Part 102
- This removes ambiguity about which regulation applies

### 2. New Transport Instrument Framework

The Civil Aviation Authority introduced a **new Transport Instrument** under Part 101 that enables:

- **Dynamic regulatory response**: CAA can modify operational parameters more quickly
- **Sector-specific guidance**: Targeted rules for emerging use cases (drone racing, educational programs, etc.)
- **Operational flexibility**: Allows broader compliance pathways without lengthy rule amendments
- **Innovation accommodation**: Framework for approving new operational concepts without formal rule changes

**Why This Matters**: Instead of waiting for formal regulatory amendments, the CAA can issue updated guidance or conditions through Transport Instruments, responding faster to industry developments and technological evolution.

### 3. Reduced Regulatory Burden

Part 101 operations now benefit from:

- **Streamlined notification processes**: Simpler procedures for notifying airspace users
- **Self-assessment tools**: Operators can assess compliance without extensive documentation
- **Clearer safe zones**: Designated areas with established operational boundaries
- **Proportional compliance**: Requirements match the actual risk of the operation

**Example**: A school operating drones in a contained field can now demonstrate compliance through straightforward self-assessment rather than lengthy approval applications.

### 4. Clearer Operational Expectations

The updated regulations establish explicit operational standards:

**Visual Flight Operations**
- Maximum altitude limits clearly defined
- Distance from obstacles specified
- Weather conditions for safe operation outlined

**Airspace Integration**
- Reduced requirement for airspace coordination in low-traffic areas
- Clear procedures for controlled airspace notification
- Simplified requirements for remote operations

**Safety Standards**
- Equipment specifications clearly stated
- Pre-flight checklist requirements simplified
- Observer/pilot role definitions clarified

## Weight Categories and Operational Limits

Part 101 now clearly defines operations based on aircraft characteristics:

### Under 7kg Operations
- Minimal restrictions in most scenarios
- Operation in proximity to people permitted under specific conditions
- No airspace notification required in uncontrolled airspace above 300 feet

### 7kg to 25kg Operations
- Increased awareness and safety requirements
- Enhanced notification procedures in certain airspace categories
- Requirement for spotter/observer in some scenarios

### Above 25kg
- Typically requires Part 102 certification
- Exceptions possible with Part 107 research approval

## The Technology-Agnostic Approach

Part 101's updated framework accommodates:

- **Fixed-wing aircraft**: Efficient, long-endurance platforms
- **Multirotor systems**: Quadcopters, hexacopters, and variants
- **Hybrid VTOL**: Vertical takeoff with long-range capability
- **Emerging platforms**: Future designs not yet invented

The regulations focus on **operational outcomes** (safety, airspace integration, risk management) rather than specific technology requirements.

## Operational Clarity Improvements

### Clear Decision Points

Operators now face straightforward questions:

1. **Is this commercial?** → If yes, go to Part 102
2. **What weight range?** → Determines specific requirements
3. **Where will you operate?** → Identifies airspace considerations
4. **What conditions apply?** → Establishes compliance pathway

### Documentation and Records

Part 101 now requires:

- **Basic flight logs**: Minimum record-keeping for operations
- **Incident reporting**: Clear process for safety-related events
- **Maintenance records**: Simple tracking of aircraft condition
- **Pilot/operator logs**: Registration and operational history

### Training and Competency

The updated framework specifies:

- **Knowledge requirements**: What operators must understand
- **Practical skills**: Minimum competency standards
- **Currency requirements**: Maintaining operational proficiency
- **Self-assessment tools**: Evaluating personal competency

## Transitional Provisions

For operators previously conducting activities under the old Part 101:

- **Existing approvals**: Valid until specified transition date
- **Compliance deadline**: Clear timeline for alignment with new rules
- **Support resources**: CAA guidance documents and interpretation notes
- **Grandfathering provisions**: Some legacy operations permitted to continue under specified conditions

## Part 101 vs. Requiring Part 102

The key distinction is now clear:

**Part 101 applies when**:
- Operation is non-commercial
- Aircraft meets weight/performance specifications
- Operation follows defined safety parameters
- Operator demonstrates competency through self-assessment

**Part 102 is required when**:
- Any commercial benefit is involved (direct or indirect)
- Operations involve complex scenarios (BVLOS, autonomous systems)
- Operating in airspace requiring certification
- Aircraft characteristics exceed Part 101 parameters

## Key Takeaways

1. **Part 101 is for recreational and educational operations**: Clear non-commercial focus
2. **New Transport Instrument provides flexibility**: CAA can adapt requirements without rule changes
3. **Regulatory burden is reduced**: Simplified compliance for standard operations
4. **Operational expectations are explicit**: Clear guidelines for what's allowed
5. **Distinction from Part 102 is unambiguous**: Commercial operations always require Part 102
6. **Technology-neutral framework**: Accommodates any aircraft type
7. **Clearer decision pathways**: Operators can quickly determine applicable requirements

## Reflection Questions

1. Does your current operation fall under Part 101 or Part 102?
2. How do the clearer operational expectations affect your flight planning?
3. What benefits does the new Transport Instrument framework offer for future operations?
