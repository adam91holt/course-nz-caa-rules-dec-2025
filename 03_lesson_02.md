## Staying Compliant During Transition

Compliance isn't a one-time checkbox—it's an ongoing practice. The transition period is the ideal time to establish sustainable compliance habits.

### Define Your Operational Category

Before taking any action, clearly identify what category of operations you conduct.

**Recreational Operator** (Part 101):
- Flying for personal enjoyment, education, or sport
- No revenue-generating activities
- Weight limits typically under 25kg
- Visual line of sight operations

**Light Commercial Operator** (Part 102 - Simplified):
- Revenue-generating activities with limited scope
- Simple operations within defined parameters
- Clear risk profiles
- Straightforward authorization pathways

**Standard Commercial Operator** (Part 102):
- Complex commercial operations
- Beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) activities
- Multiple aircraft or operators
- Enhanced risk management requirements

**Research Organization** (Part 107):
- Technology testing and development
- Experimental operations
- Approved research entities
- Broader operational flexibility within approved scope

### Category Self-Assessment Checklist

For each category, ask yourself:

**Financial aspect**:
- [ ] Are any financial benefits involved, directly or indirectly?
- [ ] If yes, what is the nature and scale?

**Operational complexity**:
- [ ] Are all flights within visual line of sight?
- [ ] Do you operate near airports, populated areas, or sensitive zones?
- [ ] How many aircraft or operators are involved?

**Technology and capability**:
- [ ] What aircraft weight and type?
- [ ] Does the aircraft have autonomous capabilities?
- [ ] Are sensors or specialized equipment involved?

**Risk profile**:
- [ ] What are potential consequences of loss of control?
- [ ] Who is affected if something goes wrong?
- [ ] What mitigation measures are in place?

Your honest answers determine your category and required compliance level.

## What Operators Need to Do Now vs. Later

### Immediate Actions (Now - Phase 1)

**Review and understand** (complete by January 2026):

1. **Read AC101-1**: The full circular if time permits, or at minimum your operational category sections
2. **Review regulatory text**: Read the applicable CAR parts (101, 102, or 107)
3. **Compare to current practice**: Honestly assess where you differ from requirements
4. **Document findings**: Note every gap or area needing change

**This foundation work is essential**—you cannot plan changes without knowing what's required.

**Plan your transition** (complete by mid-January):

1. **List required changes**: Every operational, procedural, or training change needed
2. **Prioritize by deadline**: Some changes must happen before Phase 2, others can wait
3. **Estimate effort and cost**: Be realistic about resources required
4. **Create timeline**: When will each change be completed?
5. **Assign responsibility**: Who in your organization is accountable for each change?

**Begin preparatory work** (ongoing through February):

1. **Training**: Start any required training courses or certifications
2. **Documentation updates**: Begin revising procedures, manuals, checklists
3. **Equipment preparation**: If hardware changes are needed, order and test equipment
4. **Staff communication**: If operating a business, begin notifying and preparing team members

### Phase 2 Actions (March - June 2026)

**Implement and finalize changes**:

1. **Complete all training** and certifications required
2. **Finalize all procedure updates** and staff training
3. **Conduct dry runs** of updated procedures before operational use
4. **Submit applications**: If required (commercial operators)
5. **Obtain approvals**: Ensure authorizations are in place before needed
6. **Document compliance**: Keep records showing your compliance efforts

**For commercial operators specifically**:

1. **Prepare certification application**:
   - Complete all required forms and documentation
   - Gather evidence of compliance capability
   - Detail your risk management approach

2. **Submit by 30 April 2026**: Do not delay this critical deadline

3. **Respond to CAA requests**:
   - Be available for any clarification questions
   - Provide additional information promptly
   - Allow time for processing

4. **Implement approved conditions**:
   - If authorization is conditional, implement required conditions
   - Document implementation
   - Be ready for any pre-operation audits

### Ongoing Actions (July 2026 onward)

**Maintain compliance**:

1. **Keep records**: Maintain all required operational logs and documentation
2. **Regular review**: Periodically assess continued compliance
3. **Update as needed**: Keep procedures current with any regulatory changes
4. **Continue training**: Maintain certifications and current knowledge

## Staying Compliant: Practical Steps

### Operational Procedures

**Develop clear procedures for every regular activity**:

- Pre-flight checklists
- In-flight operation conduct
- Emergency response procedures
- Post-flight documentation
- Equipment maintenance schedules

**Make procedures accessible**:
- Written in clear language
- Available to all who need them
- Easy to follow in real operational conditions
- Updated when processes change

### Documentation and Record Keeping

**Maintain records that demonstrate compliance**:

**Flight Records**:
- Date, location, duration of each flight
- Aircraft identification and condition
- Pilot/operator identification
- Weather conditions
- Any incidents or near-misses
- Purpose of operation

**Equipment Records**:
- Maintenance performed and dates
- Repairs completed
- Airworthiness assessments
- Component inspections and replacements

**Compliance Records**:
- Pilot certification and training records
- Risk assessments for operations
- Authorization documentation
- CAA correspondence

**Why this matters**: If the CAA audits your operations or an incident occurs, these records demonstrate your serious approach to compliance and responsible operation.

### Training and Competency

**Ensure your team stays current**:

- Regular skills refresher training
- Updates on any regulatory changes
- Scenario-based training for emergency procedures
- Knowledge checks to verify understanding

**For commercial operators**:
- Formal training programs with records
- Competency assessment and verification
- Training records available for CAA review

**For recreational operators**:
- Understanding of your operational boundaries
- Familiarity with safety best practices
- Ability to recognize and respond to problems

### Risk Management

**Regular risk assessment**:

1. **Identify potential hazards**: Loss of control, interference, weather, etc.
2. **Assess likelihood**: How probable is this specific hazard in your operations?
3. **Evaluate consequences**: What harm could result?
4. **Implement mitigation**: What will you do to reduce the risk?
5. **Verify effectiveness**: Does your mitigation actually work?

**Common mitigation strategies**:
- Maintaining clear weather minimums
- Keeping adequate distance from people and property
- Using safety equipment (spotters, visual aids)
- Operating in familiar locations with known hazards
- Limiting operations to experienced personnel

### Compliance Demonstration

**Be prepared to show the CAA that you're compliant**:

**If requested during audit**:

1. **Produce procedures**: Your operational procedures must be clear and consistent with regulations
2. **Show records**: Flight logs, maintenance records, training records demonstrate ongoing compliance
3. **Explain your approach**: Be able to articulate why you do things the way you do
4. **Demonstrate competency**: Staff should understand requirements and procedures
5. **Evidence of controls**: Show concrete measures you've implemented for safety

**Pro tip**: If you can clearly explain your compliance approach and back it up with documentation, audits are straightforward and non-adversarial.
