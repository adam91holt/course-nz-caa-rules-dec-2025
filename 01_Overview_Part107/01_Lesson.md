# What Changed in December 2025

## Effective Date

The New Zealand Civil Aviation Rules updates became effective on **22 December 2025**.

## Overview of Changes

New Zealand's aviation regulatory framework underwent significant updates with three key rule modifications and one major new addition:

### Part 101 Updates

Part 101 received updates to maintain alignment with modern drone operations and small aircraft regulations. These changes ensure existing rules remain relevant as technology evolves.

### Part 102 Updates

Part 102 was revised to address changes in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations. These updates reflect industry developments and operational practices that have emerged since the previous regulatory cycle.

### Part 107 - NEW Rule

The most significant change is the introduction of **Part 107**, a completely new regulatory part focused on research and development activities.

## Why These Changes Were Made

The aviation industry continues to evolve rapidly with emerging technologies, new operational concepts, and innovative applications. The Civil Aviation Authority made these updates to:

- **Support Innovation**: Enable testing and development of new aviation technologies without excessive regulatory barriers
- **Maintain Safety**: Establish clear frameworks while allowing flexibility for approved organizations
- **Future-Proof Regulations**: Create technology-agnostic rules that can accommodate advances not yet anticipated
- **Streamline Processes**: Reduce approval timelines for organizations conducting legitimate research activities

## Part 107: A Game-Changer

Part 107 introduces a streamlined regulatory pathway specifically designed for approved research organizations. Rather than requiring individual approval for each test or iteration, organizations can operate under a broader research framework.

This represents a shift in regulatory philosophy—from prescriptive, per-activity approvals to a trust-based model for vetted research entities.

## Key Takeaways

- Effective immediately as of 22 December 2025
- Three main rule parts affected: 101, 102, and new 107
- Part 107 is specifically designed to accelerate research and development in aviation
- The approach is technology-agnostic, supporting any aviation system type
- Streamlined approval processes replace the previous activity-by-activity model
